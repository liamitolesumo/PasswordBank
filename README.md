Dear Reader,

This first python project created by Liam witth the help of a of a youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLn3jOsNRVE&ab_channel=TechWithTim)
It is unfinished : 
    The problem comes from the Fernet import and the encoding system (ligne 1 and 16)
A different style could however be created, without using any encryption, just denying access to a wrong password

This project, which code is mostly from an other programmer is not written in my own coding style, which leeds me to be confused on how to debug. 

This Process was for learning purposes

Sincerely,
Liam
